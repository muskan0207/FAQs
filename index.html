            <h4>What are closures in JavaScript? </h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. Closures are created every time a function is created.</p>

            <h4>How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Asynchronous operations in JavaScript can be handled using callbacks, Promises, and the async/await syntax.

                Callbacks: A function passed as an argument to another function and executed after an asynchronous operation.
                
                Promises: An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
                
                async/await: A syntactic sugar for working with Promises.</p>

            <h4>What is event delegation in JavaScript?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to manage events from multiple child elements. This reduces the number of event listeners required and improves performance.</p>
